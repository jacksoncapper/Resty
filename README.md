<h1>Resty 1.0.0</h1>
<p>Publish a complete REST API from any MySQL database with authentication, security, and virtual tables built-in.</p>

<h3>Security Model</h3>
<p>Resty uses the concept of <em>ownership</em> to deny/accept read/write actions on resources and properties. Each action request goes through the following steps:</p>

<h5>1. Ownership Relationship</h5>
<p>Every resource can be <em>owned</em> by a user. Ownership is designated by a foreign key reference in that resource that links to a user directly, or to a resource that is owned by a user. A foreign key field that indicates ownership must be explicitly written in the field's meta comments:</p>
<pre>{"owner": true}</pre>
<p>Before a resource is written, read, deleted, the relationship between the current user and the resource is determined. This can result in 5 possible relationships:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>None</strong> - The resource has no relationship to the user
  <li><strong>Private</strong> - The resource is owned by the current user</li>
  <li><strong>Superprotected</strong> - The resource is owned by a superuser of the current user</li>
  <li><strong>Subprotected</strong> - The resource is owned by a subuser of the current user</li>
  <li><strong>Semiprotected</strong> - The resource is owned by a semiuser of the current user</li>
</ul>

<h5>2. Resource Browse Policy Check</h5>
<p>The user relationship is compared to the subject's <em>browse security policy</em>. A security policy is simply an array of allowable ownership relationships that can access the resource exists. This can be set in the subject's meta comments:</p>
<pre>{"browse": ["private", "subprotected"]}
  // Both the owner and subusers of the owner can access these resources</pre>
<p>Resty will deal with attempted access to inaccessible resources depending on the action:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><code>GET (BROWSE)</code></strong> - Resource is simply omitted</li>
  <li><strong><code>GET, POST, PUT, DELETE</code></strong> - 404 Not Found Error</li>
</ul>

<h5>3. Resource Update Policy Check</h5>
<p>If the action is a <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code> request, the user relationship is compared to the subject's <em>update security policy</em>. This can be set in the subject's meta comments:</p>
<pre>{"update": ["private", "semiprotected"]}
  // Both the owner and semiusers of the owner can update this resource</pre>
  
<h5>4. Field Get/Set Policy Check</h5>
<p>If the action is a <code>GET</code> or <code>PUT</code>/<code>POST</code>, the <em>get policy</em> or <em>set policy</em> is checked respectively to determine if each field can be get or set. This can be set in the field's meta comments:</p>
<pre>{"get": ["private", "superprotected"], "set": ["private"]}
  // Both the owner and superusers of the resource can get this field
  // Only the owner can set this field</pre>
<p>Where a user isn't permitted to get or set a field, that field is skipped. All other fields will be processed independantly.</p>
  
<h5>5. Field Reference Policy Check</h5>
<p>If the action is a <code>PUT</code>/<code>POST</code>, and a field is being set to a reference, the reference resource is considered to be being updated. Therefore, the referenced resource's browse and update policies are compared the user's relationship as if that resource were being applied.</p>
<p>Where the user isn't permitted to set a field to a referenced resource, that field is skipped. All other fields will be process independantly.</p>
