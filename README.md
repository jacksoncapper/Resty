<h1>Resty 1.0.1</h1>
<p>Publish a complete REST API from any MySQL database with authentication, security, and virtual tables built-in.</p>

<h3>Security Model</h3>
<p>Resty uses a built-in, customiseable methodology for authorising actions on resources and their fields.</p>

<h5>Authority</h5>
<p>To authorise action on a resource, the user is compared to the resource's <em>authority</em>. The authority of a resource is a user designated by an <em>authority link</em>. Authority links are the series of reference fields that link a resource eventually to the user's table. An authority link could be a direct reference to a user, or it could traverse multiple tables. Multiple authority links, and therefore multiple authorities can exist for a resource.</p>
<pre><strong>Eg:</strong> Book > Library > Librarian
  // Each book has an authority field linking to a library which has an authority field linking to a
  // librarian, who therefore is the authority of the book</pre>
<p>Reference fields which denote an authority link can be specified in the field's meta:</p>
<pre>{"authority": true}</pre>

<h5>Relationship</h5>
<p>The user's relationship to the authority is expressed as an array of values, one for each authority link:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blocked</strong> - The user is blocked by the authority</li>
  <li><strong>Public</strong> - The user has no relationship to the authority</li>
  <li><strong>Private</strong> - The user is the authority</li>
  <li><strong>Super</strong> - The user is a super-user of the authority</li>
  <li><strong>Sub</strong> - The user is a sub-user of the authority</li>
  <li><strong>Semi</strong> - The user is a semi-user of the authority</li>
</ul>
<p>Relationships can be overriden by implementing the <code>relationship</code> function in the API object.</p>

<h5>Security Policies</h5>
<p>A policy is an array of allowable relationships used to authorise a user's action on a resource. Different types of policies are used for various stages of authorisation:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access Policy</strong> - Determines if the user can access the resource</li>
  <li><strong>Affect Policy</strong> - Determines if the user can affect the resource</li>
  <li><strong>Get Policy</strong> - Determines if the user can get a resource's field</li>
  <li><strong>Set Policy</strong> - Determines if the user can set a resource's field</li>
  <li><strong>Reference Policy</strong> - Determines if the user can set a reference field to a resource</li>
</ul>
<p>Policies are specified in the subject's or field's meta:</p>
<pre>{"access-policy": ["private", "sub"]}
  // Both the owner and sub-users of the owner can access these resources</pre>
<p>Security policies can be overridden by implementing the <code>[policy type]-policy</code> function in the API object.</p>

<h5>Security Checkpoints</h5>
<p>Each action type involves multiple security checkpoints where it could be allowed or denied. A checkpoint produces a relationship, and then compares it to the relevant security policy. Only one relationship needs to match any of those specified in the policy to pass the checkpoint.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    GET
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> against resource's authority</li>
      <li><strong>Access Checkpoint:</strong> against subject's access policy</li>
      <li>
        For each field:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Get Checkpoint:</strong> against field's get policy</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    POST/PUT
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> against resource's authority (PUT only)</li>
      <li><strong>Affect Checkpoint:</strong> against subject's affect policy (PUT only)</li>
      <li>
        For each field:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Set Checkpoint:</strong> against field's set policy (PUT only)</li>
          <li>
            When a reference field is being set to an existing resource:
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> against reference resource's authority</li>
              <li><strong>Access Checkpoint:</strong> against reference subject's access policy</li>
              <li><strong>Reference Checkpoint:</strong> against field's reference policy</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    DELETE
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> against resource's authority</li>
      <li><strong>Access Checkpoint:</strong> against subject's access policy</li>
      <li><strong>Affect Checkpoint:</strong> against subject's affect policy</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If the user has a blocked relationship with any authority, this will always result in the action being denied. Fields checkpoints are processed independantly of the other fields, even if there is a denial.</p>
