<h1>Resty 1.0.1</h1>
<p>Publish a complete REST API from any MySQL database with authentication, security, and virtual tables built-in.</p>

<h3>Security Model</h3>
<p>Resty uses the concept of <em>authority</em> to deny/accept access and affect actions on resources and fields.</p>

<h5>Authority</h5>
<p>When a resource is accessed or affected, the authorised user of the request is compared to the <em>authority user</em> of the resource. The authority user of a resource is designated by any reference field that has an <em>authority link</em> to a user in the user's table. Authority links are the series of reference fields that link a resource eventually to the user's table, and to an authority user. An authority link could be a direct reference to a user, or it could traverse multiple tables.</p>
<pre><strong>Eg:</strong> Book > Library > Librarian
  // Each book has an authority field linking to a
  // library which has an authority field linking to
  // a librarian, who therefore is the authority of
  // the book</pre>
<p>Reference fields which denote an authority link can be specified in the field's meta:</p>
<pre>{"authority": true}</pre>

<h5></h5>
<p>Before a resource is written, read, or deleted, the relationships between the current user and the resource is determined. This can result in 5 possible relationships:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>None</strong> - The resource has no relationship to the user
  <li><strong>Private</strong> - The resource is owned by the current user</li>
  <li><strong>Super</strong> - The resource is owned by a superuser of the current user</li>
  <li><strong>Sub</strong> - The resource is owned by a subuser of the current user</li>
  <li><strong>Semi</strong> - The resource is owned by a semiuser of the current user</li>
</ul>

<h5>2. Check Resource's Access Policy</h5>
<p>The user relationship is compared to the subject's <em>access policy</em>. A policy is simply an array of allowable relationships that can access the resource. This can be specified in the subject's meta:</p>
<pre>{"access": ["private", "sub"]}
  // Both the owner and sub-users of the owner can access these resources</pre>
<p>Resty will deal with attempted access to inaccessible resources depending on the action:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><code>GET (BROWSE)</code></strong> - Resource is simply omitted</li>
  <li><strong><code>GET, POST, PUT, DELETE</code></strong> - 404 Not Found Error</li>
</ul>

<h5>3. Check Resource's Affect Policy</h5>
<p>If the action is a <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>/<code>PUT</code>, or <code>DELETE</code> request, the relationship is compared to the subject's <em>affect policy</em>. This can be specified in the subject's meta:</p>
<pre>{"affect": ["private", "semi"]}
  // Both the owner and semi-users of the owner can affect this resource</pre>
  
<h5>4. Check Field's Get/Set Policy</h5>
<p>If the action is a <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>/<code>PUT</code>, the <em>get policy</em> or <em>set policy</em> is checked respectively to determine if each field can be get or set. This can be specified in the field's meta:</p>
<pre>{"get": ["private", "super"], "set": ["private"]}
  // Both the owner and super-users of the owner can get this field
  // Only the owner can set this field</pre>
<p>Where a user isn't permitted to get or set a field, that field is skipped. All other fields will be processed independantly.</p>
  
<h5>5. Check Field's Referenced Subject Access Policy</h5>
<p>If the action is a <code>PUT</code>/<code>POST</code>, and a field is being set to a reference, the reference resource is considered to be being affected. Therefore, the referenced subject of resource's access policy is compared to the relationship.</p>
<p>Where the user isn't permitted to set a field to a referenced resource, that field is skipped. All other fields will be process independantly.</p>

<h5>6. Check Field's Reference Policy</h5>
<p>If the action is a <code>PUT</code>/<code>POST</code>, and a field is being set to a reference, the reference resource is considered to be being affected. Therefore, the referenced resource's reference policy is compared to the relationship.</p>
<p>Where the user isn't permitted to set a field to a referenced resource, that field is skipped. All other fields will be process independantly.</p>
